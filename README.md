# passGen
A simple password generator. Could use improvement, I'm sure.

I created this on Pydroid 3 on Android just for fun and practice. Simply enter a number from 5-20 to indicate how many characters you want your password to be. 
The code will then generate a chunk of lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers and special characters, combine those into a string and then convert to a list. 
The list is then shuffled and converted back to a string which is outputted as your new password.
